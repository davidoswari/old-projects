#pa2.py
#implements a distance vector routing algorithm which is distributed, asynchronous, and concurrent.
#it uses multithreading, sockets, and tcp connections to simulate communication between different nodes
#input file network.txt shows all the distances to neighbors of a given node (ex row 1 = node A)
#writes to output.txt file shows the computed distance vector matrix
